### Intro From Official Website

> Minecraft is a game about breaking and placing blocks. At first, people built structures to protect against nocturnal monsters, but as the game grew players worked together to create wonderful, imaginative things.
> 
> It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise over a blocky ocean. It’s pretty. Brave players battle terrible things in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea.
> 
> [You can play Minecraft on PC/Mac/Browser](https://eaglercraft.com/p/downloads/). It can be played in the browser with Eaglercraft, an AOT compiled voxel game inspired from Minecraft designed to run on Javascript. It uses TeaVM and [LAX1DUDE](https://github.com/lax1dude)'s OpenGL emulator to run a Java virtual machine fully compatible with browsers. Minecraft: Pocket Edition is available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minecraft/id479516143/) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&hl=ru_RU&gl=RU), and Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition is available on the [XBLA Marketplace](https://marketplace.xbox.com/en-GB/Product/Minecraft-Xbox-360-Edition/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802584111f7). So far loading... people have played the Browser version of the game. Phew.
